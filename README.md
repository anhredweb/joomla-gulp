# Gulp build system for Joomla!

A modern build system for Joomla! extension developers.

## What is this?

Most Joomla! extensions out there still use a [Phing](http://www.phing.info/) based build system that does the job but without using the latest technologies. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a modern [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) based build system, incredibly fast and easy to understand because it uses javascript code.

## <a name="plugins"></a> Some of the cool plugins available for Gulp:

* Compile LESS ([gulp-less](https://github.com/plus3network/gulp-less)) & Sass ([gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sass)) files on the fly
* Minify CSS ([gulp-minify-css](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-minify-css)), JS ([gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-uglify)) files on the fly
* Concatenate files ([gulp-concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-concat)) to mix various resources (i.e. CSS files) into one single file (and HTTP request)
* Run [CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/redirected) validations ([gulp-phpcs](https://github.com/JustBlackBird/gulp-phpcs))
* Run [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) validations ([gulp-jshint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jshint))
* Run [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) validations ([gulp-coffee](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-coffee))
* Reload your browser automatically when you edit any file (including php, sass, less, js... ) ([browser-sync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/)).
* Minify the size of the images ([gulp-imagemin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-imagemin)) on the fly.

## How does it work?

This is a reusable base Gulp system for Joomla! extension development. Do not expect something magical here except that and task naming conventions. This repo is just a base system to allow you to add your extensions build scripts in a standard way so you can focus on the project specific stuff. 

This base build system does not depend on any project structure because you specify it on your extension build scripts.

The main idea of this build system is that you always develop your extensions within your extensions main folder (your project's repository). The build system copies files to your test site and reloads your browser when anything that you want to watch changes. It's easy to adapt to any workflow (like symlink folders) but that's not the native way it works.
